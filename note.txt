The result shows that the first frame may not be included in scale adjust.

The lLocalKeyframe may conatain dunplicate frames

The lLocalMapPoint may contain dunplicate mappoint

replace the vector using set.



Add similarity optimization in Tracking on local map.
	0. Extract all the local ground points.
	1. Transform all the ground points to current frame coordinate.
	2. Compute distances between ground points and ground plane.
	3. Compute average scale for all the ground points.(may optional only when have sufficent ground points)
	4. Update translation of current frame.
	5. Optimze the sim3 pose of current frame using plane distance as normlize term. (optional)
	
	

Optimization based on ground points
	0. Insert a processing after local bundle adjustment
	1. Do local bundle adjustment first to find a confident local map
	2. Extract all the road points in local map
	3. Optimize the object function on SiM3 according
		|reprojected error on plane|+|reprojected error|
		


Another idea
Fitting a plane using trajectory points
The plane should parallel to the road plane
	may actually not

Current state
	Try to rotation first two frame to fit the road coordinate, but the result is weird.
	The bundle adjust processing will adjust the pose of the first frame, which may cause the coordinate totoly different.
